# CloudUploader-CLI
This is a bash based CLI tool that allows users to upload files to a specified cloud storage solution. all credit goes to Madebygps a.k.a Gwyneth Pe√±a-Siguenza for the inspiration of this project. For all intensive purposes, this overview will only be done using Azure Blob storage, and I will not make use of any other cloud providers services for now.

# Pre-requisites and Installation
Before we begin there is a couple of things we will need.
1. Depending on your operating system we will need the Azure CLI, thankfully Microsoft has made some documentation about the subject [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
2. I imagine most of you are running Windows 10/11, if thats you before doing the above install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) using [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as you embark on this journey you will find it very useful for learning Linux.
3. Creating an Azure subscription [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search/?ef_id=_k_CjwKCAiAvdCrBhBREiwAX6-6Un9y87OfbaiTJZ-agWWiht9O458eQ-9S-fGJZnaPy83eeCWhMP3x-RoCn5sQAvD_BwE_k_&OCID=AIDcmm5edswduu_SEM__k_CjwKCAiAvdCrBhBREiwAX6-6Un9y87OfbaiTJZ-agWWiht9O458eQ-9S-fGJZnaPy83eeCWhMP3x-RoCn5sQAvD_BwE_k_&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAvdCrBhBREiwAX6-6Un9y87OfbaiTJZ-agWWiht9O458eQ-9S-fGJZnaPy83eeCWhMP3x-RoCn5sQAvD_BwE), if this is your first time you can create a free acount with $200 in credits.

# Setup
1. First we must create an Azure Blob Storage Account, we can do that from the homepage of our Azure, by clicking on the side Menu button, and then going to "Storage Accounts" <img src="https://github.com/FrancoCarrera1/CloudUploader-CLI/blob/main/images/azure_menu.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="azuremenu"/>
