# CloudUploader-CLI
This is a bash based CLI tool that allows users to upload files to a specified cloud storage solution. all credit goes to Madebygps a.k.a Gwyneth Pe√±a-Siguenza for the inspiration of this project. For all intensive purposes, this overview will only be done using Azure Blob storage, and I will not make use of any other cloud providers services for now.

# Pre-requisites and Installation
