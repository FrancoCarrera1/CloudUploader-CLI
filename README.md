# CloudUploader-CLI
This is a bash based CLI tool that allows users to upload files to a specified cloud storage solution. all credit goes to Madebygps a.k.a Gwyneth Pe√±a-Siguenza for the inspiration of this project. For all intensive purposes, this overview will only be done using Azure Blob storage, and I will not make use of any other cloud providers services for now.

# Pre-requisites and Installation
Before we begin there is a couple of things we will need.
1. Depending on your operating system we will need the Azure CLI, thankfully Microsoft has made some documentation about the subject [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
2. I imagine most of you are running Windows 10/11, if thats you before doing the above install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) using [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)as you embark on this journey you will find it very useful for learning Linux.
